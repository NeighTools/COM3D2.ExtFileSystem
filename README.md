# COM3D2.ExtFileSystem

A native proxy for the ARC filesystem in COM3D2.  
Allows to add and replace **any** in-game file without rewriting ARC files.

Basically:

* Does the same thing as Sybaris' `GameData`, but **it's smaller and open-source** (for education purposes).
* Does the same thing as ModLoader, but **it always works**.

## Usage

1. Put both DLLs into `Sybaris` folder
2. Create `Mod_ext` folder in your COM3D2 folder
3. (optional) Move all the contents of `Mod` folder to `Mod_ext`
4. Run the game
